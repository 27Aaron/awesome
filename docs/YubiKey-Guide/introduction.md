# Introduction
This is a guide to using [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/products/identifying-your-yubikey/) as a smart card for secure encryption, signature and authentication.

YubiKey is a hardware security key that can be used to protect online accounts from phishing and account takeover attacks.

Unlike file system-based credentials, the keys stored on YubiKey are [non-exportable](https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016614880-Can-I-duplicate-or-clone-a-YubiKey)ï¼Œand are still convenient for daily use. YubiKey can be configured to require physical contact for encryption, thus reducing the risk of certificate leakage.
