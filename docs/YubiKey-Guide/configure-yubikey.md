# Configure YubiKey

## Enable KDF
::: tip
This feature may not be compatible with older versions of GnuPG, especially mobile clients. These incompatible clients will not work as the PIN will always be rejected.
:::

::: warning
This step must be completed before changing the PIN or moving the key, otherwise an error will occur:`gpg: error for setup KDF: Conditions of use not satisfied`
:::

The key derivation function (KDF) enables YubiKey to store the hash value of the PIN, thus preventing the PIN from passing in plain text.

``` bash
gpg --card-edit
gpg/card> admin
Admin commands are allowed

gpg/card> kdf-setup
```

## Change the password

```bash
gpg --card-edit
gpg/card> admin
Admin commands are allowed

gpg/card> passwd
```
